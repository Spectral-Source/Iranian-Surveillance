# Iranian Military and Surveillance Radar Systems

A brief overview of radar systems used for military and surveillance purposes in Iran.

## Air Defense Radar Systems

### Description
Iran has invested in advanced air defense radar systems to monitor and secure its airspace. These radars are designed to detect and track incoming aerial threats, including aircraft and missiles.

### Usage
- Airspace monitoring
- Early warning capabilities

## Surveillance Radars

### Description
Military surveillance radars are employed to monitor activities across borders and within the country's territory. These systems contribute to early warning capabilities for timely responses to potential threats.

### Usage
- Border surveillance
- Territorial monitoring

## Over-The-Horizon (OTH) Radars

### Description
Iran utilizes OTH radar technology for long-range surveillance, enabling the detection of targets beyond the line of sight. OTH radars provide extended coverage for monitoring activities in neighboring regions.

### Usage
- Long-range surveillance
- Monitoring neighboring regions

## Naval Surveillance Radars

### Description
Iran's naval forces use radar systems for maritime surveillance and navigation. These radars play a crucial role in monitoring maritime activities, protecting coastal areas, and ensuring the security of naval operations.

### Usage
- Maritime surveillance
- Coastal protection

## Electronic Warfare (EW) Radars

### Description
Radar systems are integrated into electronic warfare capabilities to detect and counter potential electronic threats. This includes identifying and jamming enemy radar signals.

### Usage
- Electronic threat detection
- Radar signal jamming

## Mobile Radar Units

### Description
Iran has developed mobile radar units that can be strategically deployed to different locations. These mobile units enhance flexibility in surveillance and defense operations. Mobile radar units, like 'Ghadir,' contribute to dynamic monitoring capabilities.

### Usage
- Strategic deployment
- Flexibility in operations

## 'Ghadir' OTH Radar

### Frequencies
- 28 MHz, 29.7 MHz

### Frequency Range
- 28 MHz - 29.7 MHz

### Mode
- AM

### Modulation
- Pulse

### Bandwidth
- 60 kHz, 1000 kHz

### Location
- Iran

### Short Description
- 'Ghadir' is an Iranian over-the-horizon radar, part of Iran's Sepehr Phased Radar System. It operates as a 360Â°, 3D-radar with a ceiling of 300 km and a maximum range of 1,100 km. Unlike other OTHR systems, Ghadir uses a shaped pulsed system, making the signal's edges hard to define. The bandwidth can vary greatly, ranging from around 60 kHz to splattering over 1 MHz, depending on the received signal power.
